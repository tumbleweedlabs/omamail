// Three descriptions of this list used to exist — the Shortcut declarations in
// App.qml, the help sheet, and the status-bar hints — and they had already
// drifted: the sheet listed Esc twice, was missing `u` and `?`, and carried a
// mouse gesture among the keys. Anything that shows or fires a binding now
// reads this file, so there is nothing left to keep in step by hand.

// The window is in exactly one of these at a time. The context is the single
// owner of "where am I": App.qml derives it from the screen, and the keyboard
// follows it — a context that is not text entry parks the focus rather than
// leaving it wherever the last click put it. Keeping those two as separate
// things is what let a dismissed compose field go on eating j and k.
