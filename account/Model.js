//
// `originY` moves the start: a `ListView` with a 200-tall header reports
// `originY == -200`, and a clamp with a floor of 0 makes the header
// unreachable and turns the first notch into a 200-pixel jump. Measured, not
// inferred — that view settles at exactly `originY` and at
// `originY + contentHeight - height`.
//
// Margins extend both ends: a `Flickable` with a `topMargin` rests at
// `-topMargin` with its content below the gap, and a clamp with a floor of 0
// answers a scroll *up* at the top by moving *down* to 0, after which the
// margin can never be seen again. (`StopAtBounds` does not correct a
// programmatic assignment, so this end comes from Qt's documented semantics
// rather than from a probe like the `originY` one.)

// ------------------------------------------------------------------ the wheel
//
// How far a wheel turn moves a Flickable, which the Flickable itself gets
// wrong on a mouse that reports finely.
//
// A Flickable answers a wheel event with a *flick* — a velocity it then
// decelerates — so the distance depends on how the turn was chopped up rather
// than on how far the wheel went. One notch arrives as `angleDelta` 120 and
// moves about 72 pixels; a high-resolution wheel reports the same physical
// notch as eight deltas of 15, each starting and damping its own little
// flick, and the same turn of the same wheel moves about 9. Eight times less
// for the same gesture, which is what "slower than every other app" is.
//
// Rotation is the thing that does not change: `angleDelta` is eighths of a
// degree, a notch is 15 degrees, and eight fractions of a notch still add up
// to 15. So the distance is computed from rotation and nothing else, in
// notches rather than in degrees — a notch is the unit a hand turns and 120
// pixels is three lines of text, which is what a GTK application moves for it.
//
// Nothing is capped. A cap on one *event* would put the chunking dependence
// straight back at the coarse end: an MX Master in free spin delivers ten
// notches as one event, and a bound would move it a notch and a half while
// the same ten notches arriving as ten events moved ten. A bound worth having
// would be per unit time, and no bound at all is honest — the wheel was
