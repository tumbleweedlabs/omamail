//
// Not how to talk to it — that is `GmailApi.js` for the strings and
// `GmailApiClient.qml` for the transport. This file answers the questions
// `Registry.js` asks of every provider: what mailboxes are there, what does a
// query mean, what can it be asked to do, and how does it sign in.

var AUTH = "oauth"

// The service's own mark, in `assets/`. Drawn on the provider chooser and on
// the setup page, where the question being answered is "which mailbox am I
// adding" — and a mark answers that before any of the words do.

// One file for both, because Google's mark is square and reads at either size.
// HEY has a second, wider one; see `Hey.LOGO`.

var MAILBOXES = [

  // Named by what it leaves out. Gmail's categories do not remove the INBOX
  // label, so "in:inbox is:unread" dredges up the whole promotional backlog —
  // measured against a real mailbox, that view came back as newsletters and
  // offers almost end to end. Excluding the three noisy categories cuts it
  // down to the same mail asking for Primary would have found.
  //
  // Asking for Primary positively is what this used to do, and Primary is the
  // one category whose search word does not name its label. The other four
  // read `promotions`, `social`, `forums`, `updates` against
  // CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS and the rest; Primary's label is CATEGORY_PERSONAL
  // and the web UI calls it `primary`. The API's `q` promises only "most of"
  // the web syntax and has never listed `category:` at all, so that one word
  // is the one with nothing holding it up — and on a real account it matched
  // nothing at all while the inbox held 201 unread.
  //
  // Which way the query fails is why this is a negation rather than a
  // narrower scope. A positive scope that stops matching empties the mailbox
  // and the badge, which is unread mail with nothing left to say so. A
  // negation that stops matching widens to every unread message in the inbox:
  // noisier, and nothing worse than noisier. That covers the account whose
  // owner turned Smart features off as well, where Gmail stops applying the
  // category labels at all and there is no Primary left to ask for.
  //
  // Updates stays in. Receipts, deliveries and GitHub's notifications land
  // there, and they are mail somebody is waiting on.
