// asks of every provider, and the answers differ from Gmail's in ways the
// panel has to respect rather than paper over.

// IMAP SEARCH has no free-text operator that means what a user means by typing

// webmail, from: to: and subject:, become the IMAP criteria of the same name;
// a space after the colon is allowed because that is how they get typed, and a
// quoted value keeps its spaces. IMAP matches a criterion as a substring, so a
// `*` wildcard is dropped rather than searched for. An operator with nothing
// after it, or nothing but wildcards, is searched for as typed — which
// matches nothing — rather than dropped, which would either list the whole
// inbox as if it were a result or quietly widen the search.
// JSON.stringify is used for the quoting because it escapes exactly the two
