// What kind of mail service an account is, and what the rest of the plugin may
// therefore ask of it.
//
// Each provider describes itself in a file of its own next door; this one is
// the abstraction over the four. Everything above it asks questions here and
// never branches on a provider id — that is the whole point of the seam.
//
// A provider answers four questions:
//
//   - what it is called, for the switcher and the setup page
//   - what it can do, because a panel must not offer a button the service
//     cannot honour
//   - what mailboxes it has, and what string selects each one
//   - how it signs in, which is the only part the user ever meets
//
// The query strings are opaque above this file. Gmail's are its own search
// operators; IMAP's are a small DSL that `ImapProtocol.js` translates. Anything
// upstream only passes one back down to the client that produced it, and uses
// it as a cache key.

// forgets to declare something loses the button rather than showing one that

    threads: raw.threads === true,
    // A different question: whether the *listing* collapses to one row per
    // conversation. Having thread ids does not settle it — Gmail has them and
    // still lists messages, because collapsing its list would cost a
