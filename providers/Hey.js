// What HEY is, as far as the panel is concerned.
//
// Not how to talk to it — that is `HeyCli.js` for the commands and
// `HeyClient.qml` for the process. This file answers the questions
// `Registry.js` asks of every provider: what mailboxes are there, what does a
// query mean, what can it be asked to do, and how does it sign in.
//
// HEY has no IMAP, no POP and no public HTTP API, so for a long time this file
// was a placeholder saying so. 37signals now publish `hey`, a supported command
// line client, and that is the interface this provider speaks — the same
// answer as "wait for a supported interface", now that there is one. Nothing
// here reaches app.hey.com's own endpoints.

var NAME = "HEY"

// One line, on the provider chooser. It has to say what the user is committing
// to, and for HEY that is a program they may not have yet.
var SUMMARY = "37signals' own mailbox, read through the HEY CLI they publish."

// Neither a browser this plugin drives nor a password it holds: `hey` owns the
// whole sign-in, including the token and where it is kept.
var AUTH = "cli"

// The service's own artwork, in `assets/`. HEY has two, and they are not
// interchangeable: the square icon for a row in the chooser, and the wordmark
// for the page about HEY, which is how 37signals present the brand at that
// size. IMAP has neither on purpose — it is a protocol rather than a brand, and
// no mark would be honest about the server somebody is actually connecting to.
// Where the client this provider runs on lives. A different address from the
// service's own: `webHomeUrl` is HEY, this is the program that reaches it, and
// the setup page links each from the words that name them.

  // one is refused rather than quietly doing nothing.
  move: false,
  // A topic id, which is HEY's own conversation.
  threads: true,
  // And the listing is already made of them: `hey threads` answers one entry
  // per topic, so a HEY row has always stood for a conversation rather than
  // for a message. Nothing above the seam has to group anything here; it only
  // has to know that a row means what this says it means.
  conversations: true,
  // Deliberately off. HEY has no archive: a thread is moved to another box, or
  // set aside, or left where it is, and none of those is what the key means.
  // Spending "e" on a move to Paper Trail would file mail somewhere the user
  // did not choose, which is worse than the key doing nothing.
  archive: false,
  // `hey spam` moves the thread and trains the filter, which is the whole of
  // what the button promises.
  spam: true,
  // HEY has no flag. Set Aside and Reply Later are boxes, not a star, and a
  // star that quietly moved a thread out of the Imbox is a promise this
  // provider cannot keep.
  star: false,
  // Every verb takes a list of ids in one invocation.
  batch: true,
  // A thread has an address of its own in HEY's web app, so a message opens
  // there exactly.
  web: true,
  // A mailbox does not. HEY has a URL per box and none for a search or a
  // label, so "Open web inbox" could only ever open the Imbox — which is not
  // where the user is standing whenever it would be worth pressing.

// The keys are Omamail's rather than HEY's where the two disagree: "inbox" is
