# Omamail — Keybindings

How the keyboard works in this application, and why it is built this way.

## The model

**The keyboard belongs to the application, and the context says what a key
means where.** This is the model a TUI uses, and the one GPUI uses for actions:
a key is not owned by whichever widget happens to hold the focus — it is owned
by the app, and scoped to the contexts where it means something.

Everything follows from that:

- Every binding lives in one table, `keys/Keymap.js`. Nothing else describes a
  key. The shortcut sheet and the status-bar hints render from that table.
- `components/KeyRouter.qml` turns the table into `Shortcut` objects and reports
  what was pressed by id. `App.qml` answers with one `runShortcut` function.
- `Escape` is a binding like any other, not a `Keys.onEscapePressed` handler, so
  it does not depend on who holds the focus.

## The contexts

The window is in exactly one context at a time. `App.qml` derives it from what
is on screen, by precedence — a page is a form before it is anything else, a
draft beats reading, a query being typed beats the list underneath it:

```qml
readonly property string keyContext:
    root.assistantEditing ? (root.activeAssistant.commandsOpen ? "assistantCommands" : "assistant")
  : root.showPage  ? "page"
  : root.composing ? "compose"
  : searchBar.fieldFocused ? "search"
  : root.calendarVisible ? "calendar"
  : root.currentView === "reader" ? "reader"
  : "list"
```

| Context | What it is | What it binds |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | The message list | The mailbox keys |
| `reader` | A message open | The mailbox keys, plus reply/forward and zoom. `j`/`k` move the cursor; `o` or `Enter` opens what they landed on. With *Preview as the cursor moves* on, moving also shows the message, and it counts as read once the cursor has stayed on it |
| `search` | A query being typed | `Escape`, and the modified keys |
| `compose` | A draft being written | `Escape`, `Ctrl+Return`, and the modified keys |
| `assistant` | Typing or reading in the AI dock | `Return`/`Enter` sends, `Escape`, and the modified keys |
| `assistantCommands` | Choosing an AI slash command | `Up`, `Down`, `Return`, `Enter`, `Escape`, and the modified keys |
| `page` | Setup or settings | `Escape`, and the modified keys |
| `calendar` | The calendar month | Calendar navigation and the modified keys |

While an AI request is running, Escape interrupts it and keeps the dock open;
otherwise Escape closes the dock. An open command menu or history view is left first.

The AI input uses `assistant`: Return/Enter sends and Shift+Return/Enter inserts
a newline. Ctrl+Return/Enter also sends for compatibility.
While `/` command candidates are visible, `assistantCommands` owns Up/Down and
Return/Enter; choosing a command fills the input without sending it. Escape
first dismisses those candidates, then closes the dock. Both contexts keep the
keyboard in the AI text area.
The `assistantSend` row's `sequenceContexts` restricts bare Return/Enter to
`assistant`, so those keys choose a candidate in `assistantCommands` instead.
Shift+Return/Enter remains ordinary text input in both contexts.

Qt 6.11's native `TextArea` accepts `ShortcutOverride` for editing keys even
after `Keys.onShortcutOverride` leaves the event unaccepted. This was measured
with a focused text area and a window Down shortcut: the shortcut never fired.
The AI text area therefore forwards its `Keys.onPressed` event unchanged to
`KeyRouter.routeKeyEvent`. The router decodes the key and applies the same
`Keymap.js` bindings and context as its window shortcuts. This is one router
with two event entry points, not a second set of local bindings. An unbound
event is left alone, preserving normal typing, IME input and line breaks.

`mail` in the table below is shorthand for `list` and `reader`; `all` is every
context.

**A text-entry context binds no bare key but `Escape`, except AI send and command
selection described above.**
There is no "is the user typing" question anywhere in the code, because there is
nothing left for it to answer: if a bare letter is not bound in `compose`, it
cannot fire there, and the field gets it the way any other character arrives.

## One mechanism

**The context owns the keyboard.** Changing context moves the focus — to
whatever that context types into, or to a parked home item when the context
types into nothing:

```qml
onKeyContextChanged: Qt.callLater(applyContextFocus)
function applyContextFocus() {
  if (keyContext === "compose") compose.takeFocus()
  else if (keyContext === "search") searchBar.focusField()
  else parkKeyboard()
}
```

This is the part that has to stay one thing. When the context came from what was
on screen and the focus stayed wherever the last click left it, the two drifted:
closing a reply left its text field holding the keyboard while invisible, Qt kept
handing that field every keystroke, and `j` and `k` were simply gone for the rest
of the session. Nothing warned — the keys stopped arriving.

`ComposeView` therefore does **not** place its own focus when it opens. Opening
it changes the context, and the context moves the keyboard. One mechanism, so
the two cannot disagree.

## The bindings

Generated from `keys/Keymap.js`. `tests/test_keymap.js` asserts this table
matches it, so the two cannot drift — three hand-written copies of this list
used to exist, and they had.

<!-- END BINDINGS -->

The bare `?` opens the complete key sheet from mail. In a text-entry context it
stays text, like every other bare character except `Escape`.

In Drafts, `Enter`, `o` and `c` open the selected draft in the composer, with what was written in it; a click previews it, as in every other mailbox. Leaving the composer saves the draft back over the one it came from; sending it takes that draft away. In every other mailbox, `c` starts a new message.

`Space` or `x` toggles the cursor row's selection in the list or reader context. Shift+click applies the clicked row's next checked state to the inclusive range from the cursor: an unchecked endpoint selects the range, and a checked endpoint clears it. Selections outside the range remain unchanged; the cursor then moves to the clicked row.

`n` and `p` walk the conversation rail beside the message on a provider whose listing collapses to conversations, opening the next and previous member in the same reader and stopping at the ends. The rail runs newest at the top, so `n` opens the stop below the open message, which is the older one, and `p` the stop above it, the newer — the keys follow the rail as it is drawn, the way `j` and `k` follow the list. They move the reader and nothing else: `j` and `k` go on moving the list cursor underneath, because the cursor and the open message are two different things. A message whose conversation has one member draws no rail, and both keys then do nothing. A right-click on a stop opens the same menu a row has — reply, archive, trash, spam, read, star — for that one message: the action reaches the member alone, where the same verb on the row reaches every counted member, and if the open message is the one taken out of the view the reader moves to the stop beside it, the newer one above or else the older below.

The delayed-send toast does not create a keyboard context. The current screen keeps its normal keys while the toast is visible. A new draft, reply, or forward can open during the delay. The send button waits for the queued message, but every draft field remains editable. The toast button restores the queued message. `Alt+Z` does the same from every context. `Ctrl+Z` remains text undo while composing or searching. If another compose is open, Omamail saves it to the provider's Drafts storage before dropping its in-memory fallback. A failed save keeps that fallback. Back and `Escape` save a non-empty composition before leaving it. The explicit Discard button remains the destructive exit.

## Why the rail is numbered and not chorded

`g i`, `g s`, `g u` and `g t` used to open the mailboxes, and they were two
problems in one row.

They were a chord, and Qt puts a deadline on an unfinished one:
`styleHints.keyboardInputInterval`, 400ms here. Press `g`, think for half a
second, press `i`, and nothing happens — no mailbox, no error, no hint that a
clock had been running. Measured, not guessed:
`0ms → fires · 300ms → fires · 500ms → dead · 800ms → dead`.

And they had to be memorised. Four bindings that look like nothing on screen,
for the four places you actually go.

`Ctrl+1`…`Ctrl+0` replaces both. A modifier has no deadline, and **holding Ctrl
puts the digit on every row of the rail**, so there is nothing to remember —
the rail says which key opens it. The numbers run down the rail as it is drawn,
mailboxes first and then the server's labels, from `Model.sidebarSlots`, which
is the same list the badges are drawn from: the number beside a row and the row
a number opens are one fact rather than two. Past the tenth row there is simply
no number, because there is no digit left to offer.

Held Ctrl is the one `Keys` handler in `App.qml`, and it is not a binding — a
modifier alone cannot be a `Shortcut`, so there is nothing to route. It accepts
no event, so what follows Ctrl still goes where it always went. It clears on
`activeFocus` rather than on release because Ctrl+Tab can take the release, and
waiting for one that is not coming would paint the numbers on permanently.

`Escape` is the only bare key bound everywhere, because it is the way out of
everywhere. With rows ticked and the list on screen — alone, or beside the
reader in a wide window — it unticks them first and goes nowhere; the next
press goes back. Where it goes is not decided by the key: the window keeps a history
of the places it has been — a stack in `App.qml`, ruled by
`account/Navigation.js` — and `Escape`, like every Back bar, calls `back()`,
which pops one entry. A draft, the event form and the shortcut sheet are
entries too, so the sheet closes before the message under it, and a reply
raised from the list returns to the list, not to the message it opened on the
way. On the root, `back()` clears a search if there is one and otherwise closes
the window.

## What survives an overlay

The shortcut sheet sits on top of the mailbox, and `survivesOverlay` is the
whole guard: without it a row goes dead while the sheet is up, which is why `e`
cannot archive behind it.

Four rows carry it. `help` and `back` keep their own meaning — they are how the
sheet goes away. `cursorDown` and `cursorUp` are handed to the sheet instead, to
scroll it, in `runShortcut`. A sheet taller than the window that could only be
read with a mouse would be the one screen here that contradicts the rest.

**The account switcher is not on that list, and cannot be.** It is a
`QQC.Popup`, and an open popup takes every key before the shortcut map sees it —
`focus` true or false, bare key or modified. So `Alt+A` opens it through the
table like any other key, and from there `j`, `k`, `Enter` and `o` come from a
`Keys` handler on the popup's own `contentItem`: the one place in this window
where the rule at the top of this document runs backwards.
`tests/qml/tst_popup_keys.qml` holds the Qt behaviour that makes it so, and
`Model.wrappedIndex` holds the only decision in it — the cursor wraps, where the
message list clamps.

## The cursor

`cursorId` is where the keyboard is. `selectedId` is what the reader shows.
They are two different things, and conflating them was the first bug in this
area: movement was anchored on the opened message, so in the list — where
nothing is open — every step resolved to the first row, and `j` moved once and
then stopped.

`s` is the one acting key that follows the reader rather than the cursor. With a message open it stars the open message, on every provider, because that is the star the button beside it draws; `e` and `d` act on the cursor row, which is the row the open message belongs to. The difference only shows on a provider whose listing collapses to conversations, where `n` and `p` can walk the reader onto a member while the cursor stays on the row.

Three rules, all in `account/Model.js` so the node tests reach them:

- **`cursorAfterOffset`** — moving. Anchored on the cursor itself, clamped at
  both ends, and starting from the end the move came from when there is no
  cursor yet, so `j` opens at the top and `k` at the bottom.
- **`cursorAfterRemoval`** — the row the cursor is on is about to leave, because
  it was archived or trashed. The cursor takes its place: the row below, or the
  row above at the end. Worked out *before* the action, while the row still has
  neighbours.
- **`cursorAfterReload`** — the whole list was replaced, by a mailbox switch, a
  search, or a refresh. A cursor whose message survived keeps its place; one
  whose message is gone starts at the top.

The last two exist because a cursor pointing at a message that is not listed
cannot be found, and `cursorAfterOffset` restarts at the top from there. Every
"the cursor jumped back to the first row" report is that.

The list is a `Column` of rows inside a `Flickable`, not a `ListView` — the
panel already owns a scroller, and nesting a second gives every wheel event two
plausible targets. So there is no `positionViewAtIndex`, and keyboard movement
has to scroll the list itself: **`Model.contentYToReveal`** decides where the
scroller goes, leaving it alone while the row is already visible so stepping one
row does not drag the list under someone reading it. It is called from
`moveCursor`, not from `cursorId` changing, because hovering a row moves the
cursor too and scrolling under the pointer fights the mouse.

## The mouse

The mouse does not move the keyboard's cursor. A row draws its own hover
(`MessageRow.hot`), clicking one opens it, and right-clicking one sets the
cursor explicitly before opening its menu — but hovering does nothing to
`cursorId`.

That is not a preference. Qt re-reports hover when content moves under a
pointer that has not moved, and the list scrolls to follow the keyboard. With
hover writing `cursorId`, pressing `j` moved the cursor, the scroll brought a
different row under the still pointer, and the cursor snapped back to it — so
`j` and `k` stuck on whichever rows the mouse was resting near.
`tests/qml/tst_hover_under_scroll.qml` pins the Qt behaviour that makes this so.

## Adding a key

1. Add a row to `BINDINGS` in `keys/Keymap.js`. Name the contexts it means
   something in — that is the guard, and there is no other. A `display` string
   is how the sheet shows a range instead of enumerating every key.
2. Add a case to `runShortcut` in `App.qml`. The second argument is the
   sequence that fired, which is how a row of several keys tells them apart —
   read it with `slotFor`, never by parsing the string.
3. Add the row to the table above. The test will tell you if you forget.

That is all. The shortcut sheet and the status hints pick it up on their own.

## Why it looks like this

Four things were found by running the code rather than reading it. Each cost a
release-shaped bug, and each is now pinned by a test.

**A `Repeater` builds no `Shortcut`s.** A `Shortcut` is a `QtObject` and a
`Repeater` only builds `Item`s, so a `Repeater` creates nothing at all and every
key goes silently dead. `KeyRouter` uses an `Instantiator`.

**`FloatingWindow` does not forward `activeFocusItem`.** Quickshell's window is a
proxy; reading `window.activeFocusItem` gives `undefined`, which reads as falsy
and quietly passes every guard built on it. The attached `Window.activeFocusItem`
is the one that works.

**`forceActiveFocus()` on a `FocusScope` is a no-op.** It re-elects that scope's
current focus item — which is the field you are trying to leave. Parking the
keyboard has to land on a plain `Item`.

**A window `Shortcut` beats a focused item's `Keys` handler.** A local
`Keys.onEscapePressed` looks live and never runs. `SearchBar` had one; what it
did lives in `goBack()` now, which clears the field and then hands the key to
`back()`.

And one thing that is *not* a problem, recorded because it was assumed to be:
Qt already gives a focused `TextInput` the bare keys before any `Shortcut` sees
them. Typing a letter into a visible field never fired a shortcut. The old
hand-written "is the user typing" guard was not holding that line, and removing
it changed no behaviour.

## Not here

**User-configurable bindings.** The table makes it possible — the rows are data
— but nothing has asked for it, and a config file for bindings needs a merge
story and a conflict story this does not need.

The AI dock occupies the right side and reduces the mail/composer area. Its own text-entry context prevents mailbox keys from firing while asking AI. Clicking back into the draft restores its normal editing context. Escape closes the dock before leaving the underlying mail or draft, and restores the previous focus.
