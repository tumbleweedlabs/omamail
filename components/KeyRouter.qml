// Turns the key table into live Shortcuts, and reports what was pressed by id.
//
// The keyboard belongs to the application, and the context says what a key
// means where — actions are scoped, the way a TUI or GPUI scopes them. One
// place decides whether a binding is live, so there is no per-line `enabled:`
// expression to copy wrongly. Escape is routed here like every other key
// rather than through Keys.onEscapePressed, so it does not depend on which
// item happens to hold the focus.
//
// An Instantiator rather than a Repeater: a Shortcut is a QtObject, and a
// Repeater only builds Items, so a Repeater here creates nothing at all and
// every key silently goes dead.
//
// This component draws nothing and deliberately imports no theme, so it can be
// instantiated without the shell's singletons and exercised in tests/qml.

  // no separate "are they typing" question to keep in step with this one.
